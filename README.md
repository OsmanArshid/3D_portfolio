In Three.js, the WebGLRenderer class is used to create a renderer
WebGL, a graphics API based on OpenGL ES, to interact with the
GPU and draw the scene onto the web page.


triangles are the most efficient and unambiguous way to represent a surface in 3D space


In 3D graphics, a triangle is defined by three points, each with an x, y, and z coordinate.

This orientation is often referred to as the surface's "normal."


By calculating how light interacts with the surface of each triangle, the computer can create
realistic lighting, shadows, and textures. This is "rasterization," where the 3D
scene is converted into a 2D image that displays the final result on your screen
